# Color Detection
### Overview
This project is a real-time color detection system that can identify the color of the pixel at the center of the webcam feed. It's a simple and straightforward application to explore real-time color analysis at a pixel level.
### Features
* **Center Pixel Color Detection:** Analyzes the color of the pixel at the center of the webcam feed in real-time.
* **Live Webcam Feed:** Displays the webcam feed on the screen.
* **Simple and Quick:** Easily determine the color of the pixel at the center of the frame.
### How It Works
1. Open and run the application.
2. The webcam feed will be displayed on the screen.
3. The system continuously analyzes the color of the pixel at the center of the frame.
4. The detected color is displayed in real-time.
### Technologies Used
1. Python
2. OpenCV: for accessing the webcam feed and pixel-level color analysis.
3. Visual Studio code IDE.
### Usage
* Clone the repository or download the zip and extract in your project folder.
* Ensure that the OpenCV library is already installed if not installed then install using the following command </br>
  `pip install opencv-python`.
* Now run the application in your IDE.
